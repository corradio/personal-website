&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Elon Musk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tech founder, and as your startup grows, you might start getting questions like “it’s not clear what the direction is”. Your most meaningful work will go from being about “building feature X” to “making sure other people are empowered to build X”. This is a very personal story about that transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was prepared. After all, I was the first hire at a startup that was scaled to 30 people in under 2 years, where I transitioned from coding the first version of everything to being in a leadership position. I had often seen brilliant coders forced into leadership positions, sometimes revealing that they were lousy leaders. I thought this would serve me as an example and as a guiding principle of how not to do things. But this would be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It all changes when you’re the founder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a founder, my level of perfectionism rose dramatically. This is partly due to how I lived through crucial moments of the company where our collective actions amount to the difference between life and death of the organisation. I recall very specific moments where our strategy decisions turned out to be pivotal, like for example the decision to change our product offering, or when we decided to build a consumer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions and motivations surrounding such pivotal moments emerge from the guts of the founder able to muster enough strength to trust their feelings and take a leap of faith. In my experience, they often involve working very hard at building something very quickly to test an idea. Nothing speaks more than an MVP where someone says “woaw, did you just build THAT? It gives me so many ideas!“. Nothing beats showing a working prototype: it enables people to realise that something that previously looked complicated actually isn’t, or that something previously thought as impossible actually isn’t. Those reactions are hard to replicate in traditional organisations, because they require some sort of survival-level motivation: when you have your back against the wall, that’s where you give your best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have lived through a few of those experiences, it changes your expectations and tolerance levels. It turned me into a highly effective builder: I would show my prototype to as many people as possible and iterate extremely fast. But as with many things in life, there’s no free lunch: you don’t become a highly effective builder without  downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over-optimising for the wrong thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting good at building things yourself invariably means that you’ll spend a lot of hours alone, learning your craft, and learning shortcuts and tips and tricks that will only work for you. In early startup days where you’re coding most things, you might lack the ability to work in a team, to teach others about those tips and tricks. That’s because you’ve become so effective that both your patience  and tolerance for incompetence is drastically reduced. You just become annoyed when someone doesn’t “get it” immediately. It’s not arrogance: it’s just that you have lost sight of where others are, and that others need time to absorb the context that you’re taking for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the situation was that I still owned everything tech. That had been the case since the beginning, 4 years ago: I was personally coding and training Machine Learning models, writing scientific articles, maintaining our whole cloud infrastructure, building devops tools to have continuous testing and release, coding most of consumer app in React Native, fixing bugs and dealing with technical customer requests. Basically I was both building features and fixing anything raised by someone shouting “it doesn’t work” - all of this while also raising money, making public appearances to raise awareness about our company, and building a team. That’s not how you build a company (it’s a good recipe for burnout though), and I knew it had to change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figcaption&quot;&gt;There&apos;s not many days without a code contribution. Heck not even many Sundays without a commit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait but why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasonable question to ask is why did it come to this? Why did nothing happen before? I believe I was underestimating how much drain it put on me. I’m known to my friends and family to be too optimistic about the things I can achieve. I think I overestimated my capacity to do tech, and underestimated the gains if I let someone else do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to build a team that would complement my weaknesses. The people who joined me early on are specialists in design, business development and growth marketing (areas that were less known to me). Instead, I should have made sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/first-fire-thyself/&quot;&gt;fire myself&lt;/a&gt; from my job, and empower someone else to take over. That would have meant hiring a software engineer and a data scientist early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I should have known better given my previous experience. It turns out that as a founder, it’s hard to let go of the things you believe are the most critically linked to the survival of the organisation. The quality delivered will inevitably go down. Features will get developed slower. It turns out that it’s ok, because the goal is not necessarily to go fast — it’s to go far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alone you go fast, but together, you go further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bigger question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most technical founders at this stage would be forced to become CEOs although they’re not necessarily a good fit. They might end up micro-managing or unable to sufficiently let go of their responsibilities to give newcomers to space they need to feel agency. I’ve seen this several times, and I know this is not easy. I also knew I had a choice, and I wanted to make a very conscious choice here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, two paths were offered to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire a people person who knows how to build teams and communicate effectively across the organisation. I could then focus on what I’m good at: building products (and prototypes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transition into a leadership position, and let go of my ability to build products myself. Instead, I should seek pleasure from empowering others to build products and to succeed. I should strive to be selfless, and to let go of frustrations that come as you lose your grip on the implementation. I should resist the urge to just do it myself because “I could quickly build/fix this”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put differently: Should I build products, or should I build teams? I looked at those two options from the prism of what I believe I’m good at, what I want to learn, and what I gain pleasure from. Then I came across this excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/first-fire-thyself/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which opened my eyes with this quote: “as the founding CEO, you’re one of the very, very few people who can hold the whole business in your head”. I realised that I’ve always tried to hold the whole business in my head, as my goal has always been to have an impact. I also realised that this was something that I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead me to carve out a path for me that meant delegate most of tech. In the span of a few weeks, I had removed most of my coding tasks by a combination of temporary help (freelancers) and new hires. It opened up a decent amount of free time, where I was able to gather and digest all of our ideas, filter them and communicate more clearly to the team what our direction should be in terms of business and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Letting go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly hard to let go of skills that have taken decades to perfect. I used to look down at CEOs who stopped coding. “Such a waste”, I would think to myself. I now realise that the set of problems to be solved is different, but the building skills remain useful: they allow to identify development shortcuts and to make more informed decisions. They also allow to get the buy-in from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I think a CEO’s role is to inspire others and to provide clarity of direction. The transition is painful however. You’ll be alone and lost. I hope you’ll feel less alone after having read that. If you also have a similar experience, feel free to reach out!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Enjoy the journey]]></title><description><![CDATA[Life is short.

&lt;p&gt;Life is short. How do you get the most out of it? What is your contribution to humanity? Does there need to be any? Wouldn’t spreading joy and hope around your close ones be fulfilling enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an article meant for those of you who have the ambition to do something extraordinary, who want to make the world a better place, to have a positive impact, but don’t know just exactly how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, when asked to inspire young entrepreneurs about what to do to change the world, simply responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, honestly, I don’t think everyone needs to go try to solve some big, world-changing problem. I mean we should just think: are we doing something that’s useful to the world? […] people should be able to be proud of doing that. It doesn’t always have to be something that is going to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Elon Musk (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ecorner.stanford.edu/videos/3620/Elon-Musks-Vision-for-the-Future-Entire-Talk&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, starts at 53min)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think: We read so many articles, watch so many videos and respond to so many notifications that we rarely take the time to listen to ourselves. We have all those inputs about how others acted in order to get successful that we sometimes forget that we all are different. Because we’re all unique, it is absolutely crucial to understand the precise conditions under which you are capable of delivering the most value. Those conditions can be investigated by studying the situations in which you felt &lt;em&gt;passionate&lt;/em&gt; about your work. They represent the balance you should strive for in order to feel fulfilled and ultimately contribute the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get there, I recommend alternating between periods of extreme isolation and introspection with periods of high activity where you push your ideas to the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know thyself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being passionate about something is a feeling that often has a deep cause, like a very positive first experience, a fortunate encounter, or a seemingly innate ability that gave you a learning advantage over your peers thus motivating you to go further. Understanding these causes is a way to understand yourself. It’s incredibly hard, and also incredibly insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get started? Stop the inflow of information. Get bored. Get isolated. Think about situations where you felt “in the flow”, where you felt energised and motivated. Where time stopped and all that mattered was what you were doing or experiencing. Why did you feel that way? Was it because you felt a sense of mastery of some advanced skill? Because you felt selfless by doing something for a purpose bigger than yourself? Because you went outside of your comfort zone and did something no-one would have done? What made you feel unique? And more importantly, what is the underlying pattern that permeates all those different situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down a set of personal values that characterise stimulating situations and clearly identifies pitfalls not to fall into. More precisely, I’d investigate how much of the positive and negative effects can be associated to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mastery of the craft itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the view of others on what you were doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the freedom of when and how you operated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the purposefulness of your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stop thinking, start doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of passion never appears immediately. Starting from scratch, you need to nurture, practice, and work hard in a given field before you achieve enough mastery to assess whether or not this is something that corresponds to your values, to a purpose you are comfortable with, which ultimately gives you a proud sense of achievement. That’s why “follow your passion” is actually terrible advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often, you first become good at something, and then you become passionate about it. And I think most people can become good at almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Andrew NG (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/13/andrew-ng_n_7267682.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can’t just do an assessment of yourself and immediately figure out the proper direction. You need to be willing to align a few possibilities, and start exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So draft out a new project, and get going. Set out clear goals, and don’t stop before you’ve reached them. There’s nothing worse than half-finished projects. You won’t nearly know as much from an unfinished project because you need to get past the hard work and do the last 20% in order to draw the proper conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that if you move from project to project in that manner, you will end somewhere where you’ll feel happy and fulfilled. It will prevent you from falling into the pitfall of constantly changing course without getting anywhere instead producing something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now the second time that I have left a comfortable job at a very respectable company without having a plan B, and I love it. I don’t plan too much ahead, but I try to make meaningful contributions around me. Who knows, those things could end up changing the world. But most importantly: I’m enjoying the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
