Results from our pilot suggest that by shifting compute jobs we can increase the amount of lower-carbon energy we consume.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>To make these predictions, Google uses <a href=\"https://electricitymap.org\">electricityMap</a>, a platform that shows in real-time how green electricity is around the world. It is also the largest database of past, current and forecasted carbon footprint data for electricity in many countries. This platform allows Tomorrow‚Äôs partners to shift their energy usage to more optimal times for environmental and financial reasons, as we‚Äôve described <a href=\"https://www.tmrow.com/blog/How-companies-reduce-their-carbon-footprint-with-electricitymap-api/\">previously</a>. In previous research, Tomorrow has shown that using electricityMap data as a signal when charging electric cars or heating pools can reduce the carbon footprint of electricity consumption by up to 25%.</p>\n<p>We are also very excited about the future of this partnership, as Google mentions that they will soon test the impact of moving flexible compute tasks between different data centers and that they will share their methodology with performance results of their global rollout in upcoming research publications.</p>\n<p>This partnership and its outcomes pave the way for other organisations with intensive and flexible electricity usage to reduce their carbon footprint and their costs, as renewable energy is often correlated with low electricity prices. If this is relevant to your organisation, check <a href=\"http://api.electricitymap.org/\">out our API page</a> to connect with us.</p>\n<p>In this special moment, it‚Äôs worth taking a step back to thank Google, all our partners, our current and former team members, as well as our amazing open-source community. We send a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has put countless hours into adding more and more countries on the map and make electricityMap a vital tool helping governments, organizations and individuals become more climate-friendly, and we look forward to increasing our impact on carbon emission reductions in the future.</p>\n<p>A few press articles about the partnership:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/google-data-centers-watch-the-weather-to-make-the-most-of-renewable-energy/\">Techcrunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/google-enters-upside-down-world-of-renewable-supply-and-demand\">Bloomberg</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/05/10/google-turns-demand-management-on-its-head-to-cut-data-center-emissions/\">Forbes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/google-tests-shifting-data-center-loads-to-capture-grids-clean-energy\">Greentech Media</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/google-alphabet/google-says-some-computing-its-data-centers-do-can-wait-sunshine\">Datacenter Knowledge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-tests-shifting-data-center-loads-renewable-energy-peaks/\">Datacenter Dynamics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greenbiz.com/article/google-redefines-what-it-means-be-100-renewable\">Greenbiz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://datacenterfrontier.com/google-shifting-server-workloads-to-use-more-renewable-energy/\">Datacenter Frontier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-carbon-intelligent-computing-platform-200316070.html\">Engadget</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-is-shifting-datacenter-compute-load-to-match-renewable-energy-use/\">CNET</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/22/google-computing-platform-will-optimize-renewable-energy-use-in-datacenters/\">VentureBeat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/green-tech-google-shifts-data-center-workloads-to-follow-the-sun-and-the-wind/\">Zdnet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-machine-learning-shifts-data-center-ops-to-maximize-efficiency-rene/\">UtilityDive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://siecledigital.fr/2020/04/23/google-data-centers-energies-renouvelables-outil/\">SiecleDigital</a> üá´üá∑</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Renewables/article12097967.ece\">EnergiWatch</a> üá©üá∞</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://miljoogklima.dk/nyheder/art7779415/Otte-unge-fra-Bryggen-reducerer-Googles-CO2-belastning\">Milj√∏ og Klima</a> üá©üá∞</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/announcing-our-partnership-with-google/","readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing our partnership with Google","date":"April 23, 2020","description":"Helping Google reduce their carbon footprint","noheaderimage":null,"image":{"publicURL":"/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/google-partnership.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":2,"src":"/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/ca599/google-partnership.png","srcSet":"/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/88c65/google-partnership.png 480w,\n/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/104b3/google-partnership.png 960w,\n/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/ca599/google-partnership.png 1920w,\n/static/4aea0e12b0926f7a27213c606bc3c36c/10460/google-partnership.png 2262w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/announcing-our-partnership-with-google/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-companies-reduce-their-carbon-footprint-with-electricitymap-api/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How companies reduce their carbon footprint with electricityMap API"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/building-a-bigger-pie/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building a Bigger Pie - Tomorrow's positive-sum approach to our industry"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1052764262","3128451518"]}
