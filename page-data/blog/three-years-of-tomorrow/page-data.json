Our <a href=\"https://www.tmrow.com/climatechange\">guide to climate change</a> has been widely shared, and <a href=\"https://www.electricitymap.org\">electricityMap</a>, with its millions of visitors every year, has enabled world citizens to better understand the challenges of building a low-carbon society.</p>\n<p>But we didnâ€™t stop there. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfSGaOhiRd0\">Greta Thunberg said in Paris</a>, the real danger is when companies and politicians are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.\nThis is why weâ€™ve been committed to combating greenwashing, such as the unfortunate <a href=\"https://medium.com/electricitymap/why-green-electricity-contracts-fail-to-deliver-green-electricity-e0d66ca31d88\">false promise of clearing oneâ€™s conscience by buying green electricity</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking back, we really owe this success to the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap-contrib/graphs/contributors\">contributors</a>. They have been the ones silently working on improving and correcting the data behind electricityMap, as we approach the 1000th pull request on our <a href=\"https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap-contrib\">open source repository</a>. To them, I extend my heartfelt gratitude and respect.</p>\n<p>But weâ€™re not stopping here. We believe information precedes action â€” only when you know the impact of your behaviour can you decide how to act. This is why weâ€™re building the Tomorrow app: a way to automatically help you understand your carbon footprint, and act on it. Itâ€™s built in the spirit of openness and privacy: your data never leaves your device, and the integrations used to calculate your footprint are <a href=\"https://github.com/tmrowco/northapp-contrib\">open source</a>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/c8e40/app-showcase.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"app showcase\"\n        title=\"app showcase\"\n        src=\"/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/fcda8/app-showcase.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/12f09/app-showcase.png 148w,\n/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/e4a3f/app-showcase.png 295w,\n/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/fcda8/app-showcase.png 590w,\n/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/efc66/app-showcase.png 885w,\n/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/c83ae/app-showcase.png 1180w,\n/static/b4d9c1d77cd3714b8a305753ecbfe9c1/c8e40/app-showcase.png 2982w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Weâ€™re on a very ambitious journey, and this is why weâ€™re <a href=\"https://www.tmrow.com/jobs\">growing the team</a>.
