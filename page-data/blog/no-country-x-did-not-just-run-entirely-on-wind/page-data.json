Taken from <a href=\"https://www.electricitymap.org\">electricityMap</a></p>\n<p>Wrong. Why? Because Denmark <strong>wasn’t able to turn off</strong> their other power plants (see figure). If you can’t turn coal plants off, well, then they are still producing electricity, burning coal, and emitting CO2.</p>\n<p>In fact, those coal power plants contributed to 65% of Denmarks electricity-related CO2 emissions. At a time where Denmark supposedly “ran entirely on wind energy”, 36% of its electricity came from fossil-fuel-based power plants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/18a888a9d44f1b908edda187768ba2ac/emapanimated2.gif\" alt=\"emapanimated2.gif\"></p>\n<p class=\"figcaption\">The forgotten coal production actually represented 65% of emissions. Taken from <a href=\"https://www.electricitymap.org\">electricityMap</a></p>\n<p>Electricity produced from fossil fuels and from wind inevitably gets mixed up in the grid — you can’t un-mix them after. This means that as long as you have coal, gas and oil power plants running, <strong>you are effectively using electricity from fossil fuels</strong>! Unfortunately, you can’t selectively export the dirty stuff to our neighbours, and keep the clean electricity to yourself.</p>\n<h2>We focus on the wrong thing</h2>\n<p>The problem with comparing renewable production to consumption, is that it completely misses the other power plants generating surplus power.</p>\n<p>The climate challenge is however simple: we need to reduce emissions, thus close fossil-fuel-based electricity production.</p>\n<p>Instead of focussing on how much renewable we produced, let’s focus on how much CO2 we emit or on how many coal or gas power plants we closed.</p>\n<p>To sum up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparing wind production to a country’s consumption doesn’t give the full picture</li>\n<li>Instead, let’s focus on whether or not fossil-fuel-based plants actually were closed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will lead us to a much more interesting question: why didn’t we close the coal, gas and oil power plants during a time where country X supposedly “ran entirely on wind energy”.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/no-country-x-did-not-just-run-entirely-on-wind/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"No, country X did NOT just run entirely on wind.","date":"June 03, 2017","description":null,"noheaderimage":null,"image":{"publicURL":"/static/8ace9d19ee7d6cc630d6800f7d76e291/electricitymap.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.92,"src":"/static/8ace9d19ee7d6cc630d6800f7d76e291/2277f/electricitymap.png","srcSet":"/static/8ace9d19ee7d6cc630d6800f7d76e291/88c65/electricitymap.png 480w,\n/static/8ace9d19ee7d6cc630d6800f7d76e291/2277f/electricitymap.png 923w","sizes":"(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/no-country-x-did-not-just-run-entirely-on-wind/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/clean-electricity-production-whos-ahead/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Low-carbon electricity production: who's ahead?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-society-where-electric-devices-consume-electricity-at-the-right-time/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A society where electric devices consume electricity at the right time"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1052764262","3128451518"]}
